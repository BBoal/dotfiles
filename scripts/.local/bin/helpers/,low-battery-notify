I think you forgot to switch it on if you plugged it in.
Might not feel that way, but I work on electricity.
I can do anything for you, but I need power.
Come on bruh, just plug me in.
I demand you to plug me in right now.
You can find instructions about plugging me in in the manual
Just plug me in for a little while and I'll leave you alone.
I don't have much time left in this world."|shuf -n1)"
